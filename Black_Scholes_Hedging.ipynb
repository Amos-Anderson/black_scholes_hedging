    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Managing financial risk requires more than just intuition—it requires models, mathematics, and adaptive strategies. In this project, we take a deep dive into the mechanics of **delta hedging** within the **Black-Scholes framework**, focusing on an European call option. Delta hedging involves continuously adjusting a position in the underlying asset to offset the changing sensitivity (delta) of an option, thereby neutralizing exposure to small price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by pricing the option using the closed-form Black-Scholes formula, then compute its delta to construct an initial hedged portfolio. As the stock price evolves over two days, we simulate the rebalancing actions an option writer must take to maintain a delta-neutral position. Through this, we quantify the profit and loss dynamics of hedging in response to market changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is structured as a Jupyter Notebook that integrates precise mathematical derivations with clean, object-oriented Python code. It features a modular `BlackScholes` class that handles pricing, Greeks computation, and portfolio simulation. By combining theory with hands-on implementation, we aim to provide a clear and replicable framework for understanding how derivative pricing translates into real-world trading strategy.\n"

To hedge the position, they compute the option's delta and purchase 687.184 shares of the underlying stock, which costs more than the premium. As a result, they borrow \\$20,281.10 at the risk-free rate to finance the hedge.\n",

    "As the stock price increases, the delta of the call option increases, meaning the hedge becomes underweighted. To restore delta neutrality, the writer purchases additional shares. This adjustment costs \\$984.52 and is financed by increasing the debt.

The writer sells a portion of their holdings, which generates \\$1,351.27 in cash and reduces the debt. However, the overall **loss accumulates to \\$11.36**.

    "These results highlight the **practical realities of delta hedging**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even in a theoretically perfect Black-Scholes world, **discrete rebalancing introduces hedging error**.\n",
    "- Small day-to-day changes in stock price cause small gains or losses in the hedged portfolio.\n",
    "- The **rebalancing cost reflects how sensitive the hedge is to stock movements**, and these costs can accumulate over time.\n",
    "- Importantly, the losses remain small relative to the size of the position, confirming that delta hedging **substantially reduces directional risk** even if it doesn’t eliminate all risk.\n",

    "This simulation demonstrates how delta hedging behaves over time and provides insight into the trade-offs between **hedging accuracy**, **transaction costs**, and **portfolio management** under real-world constraints."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates how the Black-Scholes model and delta-hedging principles can be applied to manage the risk of a European call option in a dynamic market environment. By calculating the option price and delta at inception, and simulating a hedged portfolio over two days of stock price movement, we explored the real-world implications of a theoretically sound strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results confirm that delta hedging effectively reduces directional exposure, even with discrete rebalancing. However, small hedging errors and rebalancing costs emerge due to the mismatch between continuous-time assumptions and real-world trading. These deviations, though minor, underscore the importance of frequent monitoring and adjustment in managing financial derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this project bridges theory and practice, providing a modular, transparent Python implementation that highlights the mechanics and trade-offs of hedging. It serves as a foundational tool for understanding how mathematical models translate into portfolio decisions—and offers a starting point for extending to more complex strategies like gamma hedging or stochastic volatility models.\n"
